#### Helping Translate

If you want to help translate the App you can do this in multiple ways.

With Android Studio open any of the `string.xml` files in the `res\values` directory and add a new locale using the translation editor. 
**Don't forget** to add your locale code to the `resConfig` setting in `app\build.gradle` (otherwise it wont be applied).

Or I can prepare a Google Spreadsheet for you ;) ðŸ“© scorekeeper.feedback@gmail.com.

## Donate
Score Counter is a free app without any ads and with all its features available. However, if you would like to support an indie developer from Ukraine (that's me!), you can make a one-time or multiple contributions within the app.
