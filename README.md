#### Development

##### To start working on the app yourself, you have to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (or a fork of it). Follow the instructions [here](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
2. The app uses Google Firebase, to be able to build it you need to:
   1. Create a Project on https://console.firebase.google.com/ 
   2. Install Firebase CLI https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli and execute `firebase login`
   3. Install Flutter and Flutterfire CLI https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup
   4. Run `flutterfire configure` after checkout or after changing firebase dependencies.
3. If you get an error related to signingConfigs go to your `app\build.gradle` and remove all settings related to `signingConfigs` since you do need to build signed releses of the app (alternatively create appropriate configs).
4. Open the project in Android Studio an start working.
5. Install following plugin for localization https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13666-flutter-intl or run `flutter --no-color pub global run intl_utils:generate` after changes in`lib/l10n/`.
6. Run command to generate json models and assets resources: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`. You also can use script for this action in `tools/` directory.
7. Send me a "pull request" from your repo - see instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

##### Dart Code Analysis

Analyze: `flutter pub run dart_code_metrics:metrics analyze lib`
Check unused localization strings: `flutter pub run dart_code_metrics:metrics check-unused-l10n lib`
More info https://dartcodemetrics.dev/

#### Helping Translate

If you want to help translate the App you can do this in multiple ways.

With Android Studio open any of the `intl.arb` files in the `lib/l10n/` directory and add a new locale using the editor.

If you've never used git and not familiar with Android development, download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n-apps/ScoreCounter/flutter/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb) and edit it using the text editor of your choice (notepad etc...) and just email your modified files to me.
